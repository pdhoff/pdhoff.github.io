#### Written exercises 
Do  exercise 1 from the kernel  notes, and exercises 1-6 of the 
normal distribution notes. 

#### Numerical exercises 
The R data file "ATTFaces.RData" is a 92 by 112 by 10 by 40 array, 
where the last index represents 40 different individuals and the 
second to last index represents 10 images for each of the 40 
individuals. 

1. For appropriately standarized data, compute a 400 by 400 kernel 
matrix describing the similarity between each pair of images. Plot 
the eigenvalues of this matrix and comment on the dimensionality of 
the data. 

2. Compute the principal components and plot the first six of these 
(first versus second, third versus fourth, fifth versus sixth), 
and use a different plotting character for each of the 40 individuals. 
Comment on how the principal components represent across-image 
variation.
