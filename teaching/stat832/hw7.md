#### Written exercises 
Do  exercises 14, 15 and 18 
of the normal distribution notes. Also do the following additional exercises:


1. Let ${\bf Y} \sim N_{n\times p}(\boldsymbol 1\boldsymbol \mu^\top, \Sigma\otimes \bf I)$
and assume $\Sigma \in \mathcal S$,
where $\mathcal S$ is some subset of the positive
definite matricies. What is the MLE of of $\boldsymbol \mu$
under this restriction on $\Sigma$?

2.
Consider testing $H:\Sigma \in \mathcal S$ versus not $H$.
Find the form of the -2 log likelihood ratio statistic,
in terms of $\bf Y$ and $\hat \Sigma$, the MLE in the restricted
case.
