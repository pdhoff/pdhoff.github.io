You should start thinking about what you would like to work on 
for each of your projects, and let me know what your intended 
topics are once you think you know. If you want to stray 
from the basic format described above, come talk to me 
and we can come up with an alternative format.
You should talk to me about your initial  ideas for each of these
projects by
March 1.




#### Data project

Describe some multivariate data that we haven't used 
in class that is of a reasonable size. Apply at least two 
different multivariate techniques to the data. The techniques you 
apply do not need to be "correct" or "optimal", but you 
do need to comment 
on their appropriateness, and possibly other techniques 
or models that would be more appropriate. 
The format of the project should be all-electronic and 
replicable by me: The data should be avilable via http, 
and all code should be included in with your report. The 
written component of the report should be around six pages, 
and should include 

* an introduction section where the data source is described, 
as well as a description of why the data are of interest and what you are 
going with do it; 
* an exploratory 
data analysis section; 
*  one or more methods section, where you apply at least two methods 
to analyze the data in some way; 
*  a summary of your results. 

The report should be turned in electronically. I suggest 
using R markdown to write the report. 


#### Paper project

Paper project: Describe mathematically a multivariate 
technique or result that interests you. This could be something 
we've done in class that you would like to explore further,
or something we haven't discussed in class.  The report should 
be about six pages long, and include 

* an introduction that describes the purpose of or motivation for the technique 
or result, and a brief literature review. 
* a main body, describing the technique or result mathematically;  
* a summary, describing limitations of the results, possibilities 
for extension and/or links to other work.
