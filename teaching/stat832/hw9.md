#### Written exercises 
Do  exercise  2
notes on decorrelation and ICA (make sure you have the notes dated 
Wednesday 16:32 or later). 

####  Data exercises 
Do a "paramteric" ICA for the audio data as follows: Devise a measure of 
temporal correlation in the two audio streams (possibly based on one or 
more lag autocorrelations).  Find the rotation $\hat R$ of $\hat Z_{PCA}$ that maximizes 
your correlation measure, and report your value of $\hat R$. 
Does the technique separate the signals? 
How can you tell?
