#### Written exercises 
Do exercises 8-11 and 13 in the course notes on eigendecompositions. 

#### Heads
The dataset `heads` in the course directory 
consists of six measurements on the heads of 200 soldiers in 
the Swiss army. The six variables are  

* MFB minimum frontal breadth
* BAM breadth of angulus mandibulae
* TFH true facial height
* LGAN length from glabella to apex nasi
* LTN length from tragion to nasion
* LTG length from tragion to gnathion

These data were obtained from the R package `Flury`.
Perform a PCA on these data. 
Specifically: 

1. Obtain the eigendecomposition of the sample covariance matrix, and 
   interpret the first and second eigenvectors.     
2. Find the correlation between the six original variables and the 
   first two principal components (a six by two matrix). Make a 
   scatterplot of these correlations, draw a unit circle on the plots, 
   and interpret the plot.
3. For $q=0,\ldots,6$, how much variation in the data is
   explained by the best $q$-dimensional affine approximation? 
4. The Swiss army is considering ordering gas masks, and are debating 
   between making either two types of gas masks or four. 
   If they make two types, describe how the two types should differ 
   from one another. If they make four types, describe what the 
   differences should be. Do you think they should make two or four types?

#### Phonemes 
The `phoneme` data contains $n=4509$ periodograms, each periodogram 
consisting of $p=256$ values and representing an audio sample of 
someone speaking a sound. More information on these data can be found 
[here](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/datasets/phoneme.info.txt).

1. Obtain the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix.
Make a plot of the ordered eigenvalues and the cumulative proportion
of variance explained. What fraction of the variance in the data 
is explained by the first four principal components? 
2. The rownames of the data matrix indicate the sounds that 
each periodogram represents. Make scatterplots of the first 
four principal components, indicating the different sounds by plotting 
color, character or text.  
3. Compute the four-dimensional vector of principal component means 
for each of the five different sounds. Report these values and include 
them on the previous plots. 
4. Categorize each row of the data matrix to the sound category 
that it is closest to, in terms of the first four principal component scores. 
Make a five-by-five two-way table indicating how the different 
sounds are categorized.
