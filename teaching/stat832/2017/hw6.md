####  Projects

The course website mentions some projects, including a 
data project and a paper project. I intend for these to 
be reasonably short projects where you get to explore a
dataset and statistical method that may be of interest 
to you. The rough guidelines are as follows:

1. Data project: Describe some multivariate data that we haven't used 
in class that is of a reasonable size. Apply at least two 
different multivariate techniques to the data. The techniques you 
apply do not need to be "correct" or "optimal", but you 
do need to comment 
on their appropriateness, and possibly other techniques 
or models that would be more appropriate. 

2. Paper project: Describe mathematically a multivariate 
technique that interests you. This could be something 
we've done in class that you would like to explore further, 
or something we haven't discussed in class. 

You should start thinking about what you would like to work on 
for each of these, and let me know what your intended 
topics are once you think you know. If you want to stray 
from the basic format described above, come talk to me 
and we can come up with an alternative format. If you would like to 
combine the two projects in some way, let me know. 
You should talk to me about your initial  ideas for each of these 
projects by 
March 1.
