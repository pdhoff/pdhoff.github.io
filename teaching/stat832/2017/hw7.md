#### Written exercises 

Do  exercises 1 and 2 from the 
notes on factor analysis, in addition to the following:

1. Let ${\bf Y} \sim N_{n\times p}(\boldsymbol 1\boldsymbol \mu^\top, \Sigma\otimes \bf I)$
and assume $\Sigma \in \mathcal S$,
where $\mathcal S$ is some subset of the positive
definite matricies. What is the MLE of of $\boldsymbol \mu$
under this restriction on $\Sigma$?

2. 
Consider testing $H:\Sigma \in \mathcal S$ versus not $H$. 
Find the form of the -2 log likelihood ratio statistic, 
in terms of $\bf Y$ and $\hat \Sigma$, the MLE in the restricted 
case. 



####  Projects

Write up a half-  to full-page project proposal, and turn in a hardcopy. 
If you would like suggestions for topics, come and see me.
